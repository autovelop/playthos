## Development
### Alpha
Playthos is still under development. The current version is still alpha and will only go out of alpha once it can build the same game (using all of its features) on all three major platforms (Windows, Linux, and OS X) and development dependencies are automatically resolved when someone tries to use the engine.

### Editor
The ultimate goal for Playthos is to become a game editor. The game engine is the first step to get there but it can only get there only once the source code and its continues development has become stable.

## Intro
Playthos a open source game engine that promises to make game development easy. The goal is the lay out a foundation for anyone to contribute, and end up with an engine that puts a game together based on set of basic instructions.
