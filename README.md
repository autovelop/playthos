#  Playthos Game Engine

### [Documentation](http://www.autovelop.com/playthos/)
### [Feedback](mailto:playthos@autovelop.com)

## Development
### Alpha
Playthos is still under development. The current version is still alpha and will only go out of alpha once it can build the same game (using all of its features) on all three major platforms (Windows, Linux, and OS X) and development dependencies are automatically resolved when someone tries to use the engine.

### Editor
The ultimate goal for Playthos is to become a game editor. The game engine is the first step to get there but it can only get there only once the source code and its continues development has become stable.

## Intro
I started the development of this game engine because I felt like it should be easier to built games. I've spent too much time at the end of a game jam trying to deploy to as many platforms as possible. I could have spent this time actually improving the gameplay but instead I'm rushing through documentation and struggling with SDKs. I'm sure this discourages people from getting games out there. Games that could mean a lot to someone.

In comes Playthos. A game engine that promises to make game development easy. Even creators who are not coders by profession. The goal is the lay out an open-source code foundation for anyone to contribute, and end up with an engine that puts a game together based on set of basic instructions.
