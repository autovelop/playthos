Way forward:

- Print code
- Look for repetition and highlight
- Abstract and redesign component>system relationship
  - Keep in mind:
    * text renderering
    * texture rendering
	* alpha channel
	* ui dimension need to be based on Device
	* allow renderers to work in conjunction with each other. e.g.
	  - ui, no text, no texture
	  - ui, text, no texture
	  - ui, no text, texture
      - ui, text, texture
      - texture
	  - no texture (invisible)
	  - texture, text
	  - text
	* text overflow
	* texture offset / scaling
	* ui elements can have nothing more than just: position, rotation, scale, width, height, aspect ratio, texture/text/text&texture, color
	* entity can be child/parent
